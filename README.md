Expose your Python functions via an HTTP API. `dploy-kickstart` is designed with a focus of making deployment of machine learning models as easy as possible with as clean of a contract as possible. This means that you will find configurations options that are less relevant outside of this domain.

### Installation

`pip install dploy_kickstart`

When installed it provides a `kickstart` executable. Have a look at the help functionality: `kickstart --help`.


### Usage

`dploy_kickstart` is a helper utility that can expose your Python functions as HTTP endpoints. Based on comment annotations it wraps your chosen functions to be served as API endpoints.

Let's say you have a `script.py` with `@dploy` comment annotations:

```python
# @dploy endpoint echo
def echo_func(payload):
    return payload
```

Serve this function with:

```sh
kickstart serve -e script.py
```

Let's try to call the endpoint via `curl`.

```
$ curl -d '{"foo":"bar"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST http://localhost:8080/echo/

{"foo":"bar"}
```

### Annotations

Following annotation options are currently available.

- `# @dploy endpoint {endpoint_path}`  
  Will expose the annotated function on path {endpoint_path} with trailing slash (and redirect without trailing slash).
- `# @dploy response_mime_type {mimetype}`  
  Specify response mime type, will wrap function response accordingly.
  default: `application/json`  
  available: `application/json`
- `# @dploy request_content_type {content_type}`  
  Specify allowed request content type.  
  default: `application/json`
  available: `application/json`
- `# @dploy request_method {method}`  
  Specify allowed request method.  
  default: `post`  
  available: any method supported by Flask
- `# @dploy json_to_kwargs`  
  Will map json payload's keys to function kwargs if supplied.

### Endpoint utilities

Following paths are generated automatically:

- `GET /healthz`: that always returns a 200
- `GET /openapi.yaml`: autogenerated OpenAPI Spec (WIP)

### Current dependency tree

Aim is to keep this as small as possible to not clutter the user space.
